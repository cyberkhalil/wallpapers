# wallpapers
I am uploading my entire wallpaper directory for those that want/need them. 

## Where Did I Get These?

I find wallpapers in a number of different locations.  Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions that I have installed over the years.

## Style of Wallpapers

The vast majority of these wallpapers are nature and landscape photos.  There are a few abstract art wallpapers mixed in.

## Ownership

Because I downloaded most of these from sites, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
